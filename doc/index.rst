Package for state-dependent Hawkes processes
==============================================

The `mpoints` package is a machine learning tool that implements the class of state-dependent Hawkes processes.
Its key features include both simulation and estimation (statistical inference).
It also contains a module with specialised plotting services.

State-dependent Hawkes processes belong to the class of hybrid marked point processes,
a class that models the arrival in time of random events and their interaction with the state of a system.

We strongly recommend to first read the :doc:`tutorial </tutorial>`.
It contains an introduction to this statistical model and illustrates the main functionalities of the `mpoints` package.

For additional mathematical details, please consult the :doc:`documentation </apidoc/mpoints>` and the
:doc:`references <\references>`.
