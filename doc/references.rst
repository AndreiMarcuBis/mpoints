The `mpoints` package is based on the following two references.
The first reference is an introduction to state-dependent Hawkes processes with an application to high-frequency
financial data.
The second reference sets the theoretical foundations of hybrid marked point processes.

   order book modelling. Preprint, available at http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.08060.
